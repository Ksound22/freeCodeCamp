#### --distractors--

Functions

---

Variables

---

Loops

#### --answer--

Classes

### --question--

#### --text--

Which module does Python use to implement abstract class?

#### --distractors--

`Time`

---

`xyz`

---

`Random`

#### --answer--

`abc`

### --question--

#### --text--

What and what defines the data and behaviours of an object?

#### --distractors--

Functions and classes

---

Variables and loops

---

Seeders and databases

#### --answer--

Properties and methods

### --question--

#### --text--

What is single inheritance?

#### --distractors--

A child class inheriting properties and methods from a single function

---

A child class inheriting properties and methods from multiple functions

---

A child class inheriting properties and methods from multiple classes

#### --answer--

A child class inheriting properties and methods from a single class

### --question--

#### --text--

Which of the following is NOT one of the key principles of object-oriented programming?

#### --distractors--

Encapsulation

---

Inheritance

---

Abstraction

#### --answer--

Don't repeat yourself (DRY)

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between prefixing attributes and methods with a double underscore and single underscore?

#### --distractors--

Single underscore hides the attribute completely, double underscore makes it readable only inside methods.

---

Single underscore means private, double underscore means protected.

---

Single underscore makes them public, double underscore makes them static.

#### --answer--

Single underscore is just a convention for internal use, double underscore enforces access restriction.

---

`@<method_name>.creator`

#### --answer--

`@<property_name>.setter`

### --question--

#### --text--

Which OOP concept lets you hide the internal state of the object behind a set of public methods and attributes that act like doors?

#### --distractors--

---

Abstraction

---

Single inheritance

#### --answer--

Encapsulation

### --question--

#### --distractors--

---

A method that deletes an attribute from an object.

---

---

### --question--
